to all R fellows 



-"Loading..." function in R which displays loading...(Three dots) animation like C\C++ one 😎 .



- I don't know why I created it but that was out of curiosity why We cant do it in R ?! 😁 



- Could be edited by replacing repeat loop with --for (i in integer)-- loop to work with another function 🔗 



- This only gives the idea of how the method would work in R 👨‍💼 



- This function will produce An infinite loop if you will try it , you have to click on Interrupt R and then stop to stop it (R studio) . 😵
